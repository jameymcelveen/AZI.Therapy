# Lazy-i.Therapy
My son Seth has been d with diagnosed with "lazy eye". More specifically he has Amblyopia not Strabismus, so we did not detect it as early as we should have. :-(. Anyway this project exist to help my son with his condition. Feel free to use it for your self or someone you love that has the same condition.
